# saved-request-editor

`<saved-request-editor>` An applet to edit saved request data

Required elements to be present in the DOM:

-   `request-saver` - an element to save request data in the datastore.

The element knows nothing about the request content so it has to be used in a
context of a request. It accepts `name`, `isSaved` and `projectId` properties
for requests that are already stored in the datastore.
This values must be set by the application that hosts the element. It also can be
done by assigning a request object to the `request` property. But the request object
itself is not used in the dialog.

The element fires `save-request` custom event when the user use "save" or
"override" option in the UI. To react on a cancel event listen for
`cancel-request-edit` event. Note that the event does not bubble.

To edit a history item to save it in the saved request data store set the
`is-history` attribute. It will always treat the request as a non saved object.
Note that the `request` object set on `save-request` event won't be altered
by this property. It may still contain the `_id` and `_rev` properties.
